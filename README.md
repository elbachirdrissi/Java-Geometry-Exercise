This Java exercise comprises two classes, Point and LineSegment, designed for basic geometric calculations. The Point class represents a point in a two-dimensional space and offers methods for calculating the distance between two points and translating a point by specified increments. The LineSegment class defines a line segment using two points and provides a method to determine its length. The main method demonstrates the usage of these classes by creating points and displaying their coordinates. This exercise serves as a practical exercise for understanding fundamental geometric computations in Java.
